    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Working as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer often involves querying data from various sources. There are many tools and libraries available to perform these tasks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, there are many different ways to achieve similar results, depending on the tool or library used. It's important to be familiar with these different methods to choose the best one for your specific use case.\n",

    "This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to query data using different tools and libraries, including Pandas, SQL, PySpark, and Polars. Each section will cover the setup, data creation, and various querying techniques such as filtering, grouping, joining, window functions, ranking, and sorting. The output will be identical across all tools, but the transformations will be implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library. Therefore allowing you to compare the different approaches and understand the nuances of each method."

    "## Overview of the Different Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the querying techniques, let's take a moment to understand the different libraries and tools we will be using in this article. Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right tool for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this article, you can easily switch between the different libraries by selecting the appropriate tab. Each section will provide the same functionality, but implemented using the specific syntax and features of each library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas] is a powerful data manipulation library in Python that provides data structures and functions for working with structured data. It is widely used for data analysis and manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Pandas was one of the first libraries to provide a DataFrame structure, which is similar to a table in a relational database. It allows for easy data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and aggregation. Pandas is built on top of [NumPy][numpy] and provides a high-level interface for working with data. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets and is often used in Data Science and Machine Learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a rich set of functionalities for data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, joining, and window functions. It also integrates well with other libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, making it a popular choice among data scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Pandas is both powerful and popular, it is important to note that it operates **in-memory**, which means that it may not be suitable for very large datasets that do not fit into memory. In such cases, other libraries like PySpark or Polars may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQL][sql-wiki] (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is widely used for querying and modifying data in databases. SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what you want to retrieve or manipulate without detailing how to do it. This makes SQL queries concise and expressive. SQL is particularly well-suited for working with large datasets and complex queries. It provides powerful features for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data. SQL is the backbone of many database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is actually a language (like Python is a language), not a library (like Pandas is a library), and it is used to interact with relational databases. The core of the SQL language is actually an [ISO standard][sql-iso], which means that the basic syntax and functionality are consistent across different database systems. However, each database system may have its own extensions or variations of SQL, which can lead to differences in syntax and features. Each database system can be considered as variations (or dialects) of SQL, with their own specific features and optimizations and syntax ehnancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more popular SQL dialects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"mdx-three-columns\" markdown>\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SQLite]\n",
    "- [PostgreSQL]\n",
    "- [MySQL]\n",
    "- [Spark SQL][spark-sql]\n",
    "- [SQL Server (t-SQL)][t-sql]\n",
    "- [Oracle SQL (pl-SQL)][pl-sql]\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "[PySpark] is the Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework that allows for large-scale data processing. PySpark provides a high-level interface for working with Spark, making it easier to write distributed data processing applications in Python. It is particularly well-suited for big data processing and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark provides a DataFrame API similar to Pandas, but it is designed to work with large datasets that do not fit into memory. It allows for distributed data processing across a cluster of machines, making it suitable for big data applications. PySpark supports various data sources, including [HDFS], [S3], [ADLS], and [JDBC], and provides powerful features for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While PySpark is a powerful tool for big data processing, it can be more complex to set up and use compared to Pandas. It requires a Spark cluster and may have a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with distributed computing concepts. However, it is an excellent choice for processing large datasets and performing complex data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polars\n",
    "\n",
    "[Polars] is a fast DataFrame library for Python that is designed for high-performance data manipulation. It is built on top of Rust and provides a DataFrame API similar to Pandas, but with a focus on performance and memory efficiency. Polars is particularly well-suited for large datasets and complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polars supports lazy evaluation, which allows for optimizations in query execution. Polars also provides powerful features for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data, making it a great choice for data analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Polars is a relatively new library compared to Pandas, it has gained popularity for its performance and ease of use. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Pandas, allowing users to leverage its performance benefits without significant changes to their existing code. It is particularly useful for data scientists and analysts who need to work with large datasets and require fast data manipulation capabilities. The setup is simple and straightforward, similar to Pandas, and less complex than PySpark. It is a great choice for data analysis tasks that require high performance and memory efficiency."

The [`.createDataFrame()`][pyspark-createdataframe] method is expecting the data to be oriented by _row_. Meaning that the data should be in the form of a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row of data. However, we currently have our data is oriented by _column_, where the dictionarieshave keys as column names and values as lists of data.
